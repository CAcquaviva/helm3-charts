# Kong Mesh

[Kong Mesh](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/kong-mesh/) is an enterprise-grade service mesh that runs on both Kubernetes and VMs on any cloud. Built on top of Envoy and focused on simplicity, it enables microservices transformation with out-of-the-box service connectivity and discovery, zero-trust security, traffic reliability and global observability across all traffic including cross-cluster deployments.

#### Start, Secure and Scale With Ease
Deploy a turnkey service mesh with a single command. Group services by attributes to efficiently apply policies. Manage multiple service meshes as tenants of a single control plane to provide scale and reduce operational costs.

#### Run Anywhere
Deploy the service mesh across any environment, including multi-cluster, multi-cloud and multi-platform. Manage service meshes natively in Kubernetes using CRDs, or start with a service mesh in VM environments and migrate to Kubernetes at your own pace.

#### Connect Services End-to-End
Integrate into the Kong Enterprise platform for full stack connectivity, including ingress and egress traffic for your service mesh. Expose mesh services for internal or external consumption and manage the full lifecycle of APIs.
